Specifically, the Department invited States/ entities to request a waiver for the 2019-2020 school year, of the assessment requirements in section 1111(b)(2) of the ESEA, the accountability and school identification requirements in sections 1111(c)(4) and 1111(d)(2)(C)-(D), and certain reporting requirements related to assessments and accountability in section 1111(h). Under these waivers, which all States/ entities requested and received, States/ entities did not have data necessary to submit certain files, including the assessment data files, for SY 2019-2020. OSEP did not collect any SY 2019-20 IDEA Part B Assessment data.",

The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions. CCD school and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. The point locations and administrative attributes in this data layer represent the most current CCD collection.

Specifically, the Department invited States/ entities to request a waiver for the 2019-2020 school year, of the assessment requirements in section 1111(b)(2) of the ESEA, the accountability and school identification requirements in sections 1111(c)(4) and 1111(d)(2)(C)-(D), and certain reporting requirements related to assessments and accountability in section 1111(h). Under these waivers, which all States/ entities requested and received, States/ entities did not have data necessary to submit certain files, including the assessment data files, for SY 2019-2020. OSEP did not collect any SY 2019-20 IDEA Part B Assessment data.",

Citizen and specified noncitizen students demonstrating financial need and planning to attend eligible degree or certificate programs in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the outlying areas as regular students are eligible to apply for FAFSA 2014-15. FAFSA 2014-15 resulted in an expected family contribution (EFC) for each applying student. Statistics produced from FAFSA 2014-15 include application volumes by postsecondary school, state of legal residence, and completion by high school; and recipient and volume data by program for each school participating in Title IV programs.",

FAFSA 2012-13 (https://studentaid.ed.gov/) is a universe data collection of eligible incoming postsecondary education students, along with a subset of eligible continuing postsecondary education students, that collects financial information to determine the need and eligibility for financial assistance during postsecondary education. FAFSA 2012-13 applications are accepted via web and paper submission. Citizen and specified noncitizen students demonstrating financial need and planning to attend eligible degree or certificate programs in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the outlying areas as regular students are eligible to apply for FAFSA 2012-13. FAFSA 2012-13 resulted in an expected family contribution (EFC) for each applying student. Statistics produced from FAFSA 2012-13 include application volumes by postsecondary school, state of legal residence, and completion by high school; and recipient and volume data by program for each school participating in Title IV programs.",

FAFSA 2013-14 (https://studentaid.ed.gov/) is a universe data collection of eligible incoming postsecondary education students, along with a subset of eligible continuing postsecondary education students, that collects financial information to determine the need and eligibility for financial assistance during postsecondary education. FAFSA 2013-14 applications are accepted via web and paper submission. Citizen and specified noncitizen students demonstrating financial need and planning to attend eligible degree or certificate programs in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the outlying areas as regular students are eligible to apply for FAFSA 2013-14. FAFSA 2013-14 resulted in an expected family contribution (EFC) for each applying student. Statistics produced from FAFSA 2013-14 include application volumes by postsecondary school, state of legal residence, and completion by high school; and recipient and volume data by program for each school participating in Title IV programs.",

FAFSA 2011-12 (https://studentaid.ed.gov/) is a universe data collection of eligible incoming postsecondary education students, along with a subset of eligible continuing postsecondary education students, that collects financial information to determine the need and eligibility for financial assistance during postsecondary education. FAFSA 2011-12 applications are accepted via web and paper submission. Citizen and specified noncitizen students demonstrating financial need and planning to attend eligible degree or certificate programs in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the outlying areas as regular students are eligible to apply for FAFSA 2011-12. FAFSA 2011-12 resulted in an expected family contribution (EFC) for each applying student. Statistics produced from FAFSA 2011-12 include application volumes by postsecondary school, state of legal residence, and completion by high school; and recipient and volume data by program for each school participating in Title IV programs.",

FAFSA 2009-10 (https://studentaid.ed.gov/) is a universe data collection of eligible incoming postsecondary education students, along with a subset of eligible continuing postsecondary education students, that collects financial information to determine the need and eligibility for financial assistance during postsecondary education. FAFSA 2009-10 applications are accepted via web and paper submission. Citizen and specified noncitizen students demonstrating financial need and planning to attend eligible degree or certificate programs in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the outlying areas as regular students are eligible to apply for FAFSA 2009-10. FAFSA 2009-10 resulted in an expected family contribution (EFC) for each applying student. Statistics produced from FAFSA 2009-10 include application volumes by postsecondary school, state of legal residence, and completion by high school; and recipient and volume data by program for each school participating in Title IV programs.",

The Census Bureau calculates the income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) based on\r\nmoney income reported for families relative to the poverty thresholds, which\r\nare determined based on the family size and structure. Noncash benefits (such\r\nas food stamps and housing subsidies) are excluded, as are capital gains and\r\nlosses. The IPR is the percentage of family income that is above or below the\r\nfederal poverty level. The IPR indicator ranges from 0 to a top-coded value of\r\n999. A family with income at the poverty threshold has an IPR value of 100. The\r\nestimates in this file reflect the IPR for the neighborhoods around schools\r\nwhich may be different from the neighborhood conditions of students enrolled in\r\nschools.

School districts are single-purpose administrative units designed by state and local officials to organize and provide public education for local residents. District boundaries are collected for NCES by the U.S. Census Bureau to support educational research and program administration, and the boundaries are essential for constructing district-level estimates of the number of children in poverty. <br /><br />The Census Bureauâ€™s School District Boundary Review program (SDRP) (<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sdrp.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sdrp.html</a>) obtains the boundaries, names, and grade ranges from state officials, and integrates these updates into Census TIGER. Census TIGER boundaries include legal maritime buffers for coastal areas by default, but the NCES composite file removes these buffers to facilitate broader use and cleaner cartographic representation. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop the composite school district files. The inputs for this data layer were developed from Census TIGER/Line 2021 and represent boundaries reported for the 2020-2021 school year.

District boundaries are collected for NCES by the U.S. Census Bureau to develop demographic estimates and to support educational research and program administration. The NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) program is an annual collection of basic administrative characteristics for all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. These characteristics are reported by state education officials and include directory information, number of students, number of teachers, grade span, and other conditions.

School districts are special-purpose governments and administrative\r\n units designed by state and local officials to provide public education\r\n for local residents. District boundaries are collected for NCES by the \r\nU.S. Census Bureau to develop demographic estimates and to support \r\neducational research and program administration. The NCES Common Core of\r\n Data (CCD) program is an annual collection of basic administrative \r\ncharacteristics for all public schools, school districts, and state \r\neducation agencies in the United States. These characteristics are \r\nreported by state education officials and include directory information,\r\n number of students, number of teachers, grade span, and other \r\nconditions. The administrative attributes in this layer were developed \r\nfrom the 2020-2021 CCD collection.

The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions. CCD school and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. The point locations and administrative attributes in this data layer represent the most current CCD collection.

The PSS is conducted to provide a biennial count of the total number of private schools, teachers, and students. The PSS school location and associated geographic area assignments are derived from reported information about the physical location of private schools. The school geocode file includes supplemental geographic information for the universe of schools reported in the 2019-2020 PSS school collection, and they can be integrated with the survey files through use of institutional identifiers included in both sources.

The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions.  School and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. The point locations in this data layer were developed from the 2021-2022 CCD collection.

School districts are special-purpose administrative\r\n units designed by state and local officials to provide public education\r\n for local residents. District boundaries are collected for NCES by the \r\nU.S. Census Bureau to develop demographic estimates and to support \r\neducational research and program administration. The NCES Common Core of\r\n Data (CCD) program is an annual collection of basic administrative \r\ncharacteristics for all public schools, school districts, and state \r\neducation agencies in the United States. These characteristics are \r\nreported by state education officials and include directory information,\r\n number of students, number of teachers, grade span, and other \r\nconditions. The administrative attributes in this layer were developed \r\nfrom the 2019-2020 CCD collection.

School districts are special-purpose administrative\r\n units designed by state and local officials to provide public education\r\n for local residents. District boundaries are collected for NCES by the \r\nU.S. Census Bureau to develop demographic estimates and to support \r\neducational research and program administration. The NCES Common Core of\r\n Data (CCD) program is an annual collection of basic administrative \r\ncharacteristics for all public schools, school districts, and state \r\neducation agencies in the United States. These characteristics are \r\nreported by state education officials and include directory information,\r\n number of students, number of teachers, grade span, and other \r\nconditions. The administrative attributes in this layer were developed \r\nfrom the 2017-2018 CCD collection.

The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions. The CCD program also provides fiscal data about school district revenues and expenditures. CCD school and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for schools reported in the annual CCD directory file. The point locations in this data layer were developed from the 2017-2018 CCD collection. For more information about NCES school point data, see: https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/SchoolLocations.",

The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions. The CCD program also provides fiscal data about school district revenues and expenditures. CCD school and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau's Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for schools reported in the annual CCD directory file. The point locations in this data layer were developed from the 2018-2019 CCD collection.

The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau's Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for schools reported in the annual CCD directory file. The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions. CCD school and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. The point locations and administrative attributes in this data layer were developed from the 2019-2020 CCD collection.

The NCES EDGE program \r\ncollaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau's Education Demographic, \r\nGeographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point \r\nlocations for schools reported in the annual CCD directory file. The CCD\r\n program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all \r\npublic schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the \r\nUnited States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials\r\n and include basic directory and contact information for schools and \r\nschool districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics,\r\n number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative\r\n conditions. CCD school and agency point locations are derived from \r\nreported information about the physical location of schools and agency \r\nadministrative offices. The point locations and administrative \r\nattributes in this data layer were developed from the 2017-2018 CCD \r\ncollection.

The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school.

In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school.

The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school.

In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school.

In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school.

The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school. The data profiles include percentages (along with associated margins of error) that allow for comparison of school district-level conditions across the U.S. For more information about the NCES ACS-ED collection, visit the NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program at: </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS</a><div><br /></div><div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Annotation values are negative value representations of estimates and have values when non-integer information needs to be represented.

The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school. The data profiles include percentages (along with associated margins of error) that allow for comparison of school district-level conditions across the U.S. For more information about the NCES ACS-ED collection, visit the NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program at: </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS</a><div><br /></div><div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Annotation values are negative value representations of estimates and have values when non-integer information needs to be represented.

The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school. The data profiles include percentages (along with associated margins of error) that allow for comparison of school district-level conditions across the U.S. For more information about the NCES ACS-ED collection, visit the NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program at: </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS</a></div><div><br /></div><div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Annotation values are negative value representations of estimates and have values when non-integer information needs to be represented.

The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school. The data profiles include percentages (along with associated margins of error) that allow for comparison of school district-level conditions across the U.S. For more information about the NCES ACS-ED collection, visit the NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program at: </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS</a><div><br /></div><div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Annotation values are negative value representations of estimates and have values when non-integer information needs to be represented.

The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school. The data profiles include percentages (along with associated margins of error) that allow for comparison of school district-level conditions across the U.S. For more information about the NCES ACS-ED collection, visit the NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program at: </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS</a><div><br /></div><div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Annotation values are negative value representations of estimates and have values when non-integer information needs to be represented.

The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school. The data profiles include percentages (along with associated margins of error) that allow for comparison of school district-level conditions across the U.S. For more information about the NCES ACS-ED collection, visit the NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program at: </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS</a><div><br /></div><div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Annotation values are negative value representations of estimates and have values when non-integer information needs to be represented.

The ACS is a continuous household survey that collects social, demographic, economic, and housing information from the population in the United States each month.

Noncash benefits (such as food stamps and housing subsidies) are excluded, as are capital gains and losses. The IPR is the percentage of family income that is above or below the federal poverty level. The IPR indicator ranges from 0 to a top-coded value of 999. A family with income at the poverty threshold has an IPR value of 100.

The ACS is a continuous household survey that collects social, demographic, economic, and housing information from the population in the United States each month. The Census Bureau calculates the income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) based on money income reported for families relative to the poverty thresholds, which are determined based on the family size and structure. Noncash benefits (such as food stamps and housing subsidies) are excluded, as are capital gains and losses. The IPR is the percentage of family income that is above or below the federal poverty level. The IPR indicator ranges from 0 to a top-coded value of 999. A family with income at the poverty threshold has an IPR value of 100.

The ACS is a continuous household survey that collects social, demographic, economic, and housing information from the population in the United States each month. The Census Bureau calculates the income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) based on money income reported for families relative to the poverty thresholds, which are determined based on the family size and structure. Noncash benefits (such as food stamps and housing subsidies) are excluded, as are capital gains and losses. The IPR is the percentage of family income that is above or below the federal poverty level. The IPR indicator ranges from 0 to a top-coded value of 999. A family with income at the poverty threshold has an IPR value of 100. The estimates in this file reflect the IPR for the neighborhoods around schools which may be different from the neighborhood conditions of students enrolled in schools.</span></font></div><div><font face='Avenir Next W01, Avenir Next W00, Avenir Next, Avenir, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif'><span style='font-size:16px;'><br /></span></font></div><div><font face='Avenir Next W01, Avenir Next W00, Avenir Next, Avenir, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif'><span style='font-size:16px;'>All information contained in this file is in the public domain.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. School Districts are single-purpose administrative units within which local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The Census Bureau obtains the boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels for school districts from State officials for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with estimates of the number of children in poverty within each school district. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to States and school districts. TIGER/Line Shapefiles include separate shapefiles for elementary, secondary and unified school districts. This file combines all three shapefiles into one. This results in overlaps in some areas. Elementary districts will appear in front of secondary districts (where applicable). The school district boundaries are those in effect for the 2013-2014 school year.</span></p><p><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

The criteria for these classifications are defined by NCES, but they rely on standard geographic areas developed and maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau. The 2020 NCES Locale boundaries are based on geographic areas represented in Census TIGER/Line 2020. The NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to annually update the locale boundaries.

Attendance boundaries, sometimes known as school catchment areas, define the geographic extent served by a local school for the purpose of student assignments. School district administrators create attendance areas to help organize and plan district-wide services, and districts may adjust individual school boundaries to help balance the physical capacity of local schools with changes in the local school-age population. The SABS collection includes boundaries for more than 70,000 schools in over 12,000 school districts throughout the U.S.All information contained in this file is in the public domain. Data users are advised to review NCES program documentation and feature class metadata to understand the limitations and appropriate use of these data.",
